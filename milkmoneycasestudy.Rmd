# Executive Summary
This section is to be written last and contains a short (approx 250 words)
summary of the case study as a whole.  

# Background
Summarizes the case study prompt. Contains any basic term definitions and
prepares reader for discussion. Should propose basic question so that Methods
section can dive right in.  

# Methods
## Initial Considerations
To help Gerard with his put option deliberations, we must analyze the data that
he has collected. We have feature columns _Month_, _Mailbox_, _Class.Iv_,
_Class.III_, _Butter_, _NFDM_. Please refer to __Codeblock 1__ in the _Appendix_
to see the first six rows of this data set to get a feel for it. 
Details how we arrived at the models that we use. This is all about the process.
Our thought processes should be detailed so that there is no question how we got
to our models.  

# Results
Details the actual model and how it worked. This needs to do all of the leg work
so that the Conclusions section can roll through the answers to the questions.  

# Conclusions
Integrate the answers to the questions as seamlessly as possible. The goal is
that everything is built up to this point so that little justification is needed
and other general conclusions can be included.  

# Appendix
\begin{center} \textbf{Codeblock 1} \end{center}

```{r}
milk <- read.csv("41330727.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(milk)
```

All of the R code and figures referenced throughout the above sections are
included here. This is the section that we use to prove that we have done all of
the work.
